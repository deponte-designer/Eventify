## Description

This project aims to create a music dashboard with form inputs. When a user searches for a music artist or band they are presented with information including band biography, and play count data including their most played albums (and album artwork) using the LastFM API. 
User is also presented with a list of alternative suggested artists based on their selection.
Lastly, via the Ticketmaster API, the user can see the next 4 confirmed events for the artist and follow the link to the Ticketmaster website to book tickets.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
