# Eventify


## Description
This project aims to create a music dashboard with form inputs. When a user searches for a music artist or band they are presented with information including band biography, and play count data including their most played albums (and album artwork) using the LastFM API. 
User is also presented with a list of alternative suggested artists based on their selection.
Lastly, via the Ticketmaster API, the user can see the next four confirmed events for the artist and follow the link to the one e-commerce website to book tickets.
